Worked towards automating the visual inspection process to confirm the quality of industrial leather.Implemented a Deep-Learning (CSP-DenseNet-based) leather defect classification algorithm to detect defects and
classify leather images into six categories.
A data-set of 3600 images was used to train the Deep-Learning model and final average training accuracy =
91.2646, validation accuracy = 90.41667 was achieved.
